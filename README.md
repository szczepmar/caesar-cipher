# caesar-cipher

## 1. About

This is a basic script to encrypt or decrypt words using caesar cipher method, with brute force method and testing if is it working correctly.

This is a small projects after a Python course during my studies. I wanted to create a simple script that uses caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt words. Only addition is graphical version of this script to get familiar with working with GUI.

## 2. Prerequisites

The only thing you need to install is tkinter, if you want to use version with GUI. Same results you can get running main.py file, but everything will be in CLI.
